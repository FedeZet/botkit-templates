# ðŸš€ Getting started with Heroku

The first step for to the bot to work is to configure the necessary environment variables. These variables are stored in the `.env.example` file. You must change the file to `.env` and fill in the values.

After filling in the values, run `npm run heroku` to push the environment variables to Heroku.

Every change you make to your bot will need to be deployed to Heroku. You can use the `npm run heroku` command to do this.
